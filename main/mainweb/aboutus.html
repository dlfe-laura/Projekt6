      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <p>
        Projekt Sex (P6) is a politically and religiously independent student association 
        affiliated with Lund University. Our mission is to promote sexual health on physical, 
        emotional, and social levels among students. We aim to raise awareness and encourage 
        safer sexual behaviors while fostering respect for diverse sexualities. 

        Operating primarily through peer education, we provide information, distribute free condoms, 
        and offer support to students. Our activities include "condom raids" at student events, 
        educational workshops, film evenings, and discussion meetings. 

        Membership is free for students who are part of Studentlund. Our office is located on the 
        third floor at AF Borgen, and we welcome all students to visit for resources 
        or to get involved.

            Projekt Sex (P6) was established in 1991 in Lund, Sweden, as a peer education initiative 
            under the Student Health and Skin Clinic. This initiative emerged in response to alarming 
            rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among students at Lund University. Traditional 
            fear-based campaigns had proven ineffective, prompting the adoption of a peer-led approach 
            to sexual health education. 

            The peer education model, where students educate fellow students, quickly gained traction. 
            Throughout the 1990s, studies consistently demonstrated the program's positive impact on 
            student sexual health. 

            By 2009, P6 played a pivotal role in founding the national umbrella organization Students for 
            Sexual Health (SfSH), uniting over ten student-led sexual health groups across Sweden.

            In 2019, P6 faced significant challenges due to the loss of state funding, leading to a 
            temporary suspension of operations. Despite these setbacks, the organization has remained a 
            vital part of Lund's student community, continually adapting to meet the evolving needs of 
            its members. 

            In 2022 (?) P6 re-established its operations with the support of RFSU.
